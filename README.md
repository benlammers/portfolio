# Portfolio Reviewed on Syntax
This branch's sole purpose is to provide a snapshot and archive of the version of my personal portfolio that the guys on the Syntax podcast reviewed.
My hope is that any future listeners of the episode can navigate to this version when listening to the comments made by Wes and Scott.
